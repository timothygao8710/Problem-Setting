# Problem-Setting
This repository contains the problems I've written for various programming competitions, to give back to the competitive programming community. Code, Editorial, and Test Data are included.

My goal with editorials is to not just reveal the solution, but also explain **why** it works and shed light on the intuition behind **how** I arrived at the solution (my thought process).
