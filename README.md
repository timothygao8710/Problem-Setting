# Problem-Setting
The (hopefully good) problems that I have created for various programming competitions, with test data and editorials.

My goal with the editorials I've written is to not just reveal the solution, but also explain **why** it works and shed light on the intuition behind **how** I arrived at the solution (my thought process).

## Problems
